    Hi, I’m <strong>Wilson</strong>, <br>
    <br>
    I’m a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience developing business
    solutions for more than
    for 14 companies during my career.

    <br> <br>

    I have a broad number of skills but recently I have been working mainly with
    Angular & C# to build projects following a Monolithics or Microservice
    architecture.

     <br><br>

    My personality allows me to fit well in teams and my experience sometimes
    grants me the lead position Lead role in many projects. I don’t necessarily
    seek for lead roles, but I embrace them when given to me. I just strive to
    make the team successful.

    <br><br>
    According to <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">16Personalities</a> my personality resembles the  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality" target="_blank">Logistician</a> type which you can learn
